<p>Strider is an Open Source Continuous Integration and Deployment platform. It is written in JavaScript/Node.JS and uses MongoDB. It is released under the BSD license. While similar conceptually to systems such as Travis and Jenkins, Strider is designed to be easy to setup, use, and customize.</p>

<a name="strider-philosophy" class="anchor" href="#strider-philosophy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Strider Philosophy</h3>

<p>We believe that Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes improve the quality and reliability of software.</p>

<p>We want to make these processes more accessible, and one of the main blockers is well-designed, high quality CI and CD tooling.</p>

<p>By choosing sane defaults, automating to the extent possible, and minimizing extraneous UI, Strider can elegantly meet the needs of 80+% users out of the box.</p>

<p>However we realise that in the real-world, integration with other systems and customization is often required. For this reason, Strider has been designed from the ground up to be as easy as reasonably possible to customize and extend - in very powerful ways.</p>

<p>Strider has robust support for extensions (which are simply NPM modules). Have a complex workflow to trigger builds and deployments? Write a Job plugin to handle it. Use an unsupported VCS? Write a Provider plugin.</p>
